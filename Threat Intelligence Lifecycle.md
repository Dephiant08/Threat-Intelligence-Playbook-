# Threat Intelligence Lifecycle

The Threat Intelligence Lifecycle is a process that transforms raw data into actionable insights. This guide outlines the six key phases of the lifecycle and how organizations can implement them effectively.

## 1. **Planning and Direction**:
    - Define the goals and objectives of the threat intelligence program.
    - Identify key stakeholders (security teams, executives, etc.) and determine their intelligence requirements.
    - Align threat intelligence initiatives with overall organizational security goals.

## 2. **Collection**:
    - Gather data from multiple sources: open-source intelligence (OSINT), internal logs, external threat feeds (e.g., FireEye, IBM X-Force), and dark web monitoring.
    - Use automated tools such as ThreatConnect or MISP (Malware Information Sharing Platform) for continuous collection.

## 3. **Processing**:
    - Organize and structure raw data into a usable format (remove duplicate data, standardize formatting).
    - Use automation tools for filtering relevant data to reduce noise, such as SIEM tools (Splunk, QRadar).

## 4. **Analysis**:
    - Correlate and analyze data to identify patterns and potential threats.
    - Conduct threat modeling and attack surface analysis to evaluate the impact on your organization.
    - Tools: MITRE ATT&CK, Threat Intelligence Platforms (TIPs) like Anomali.

## 5. **Dissemination**:
    - Share actionable intelligence with relevant teams (SOC, IR teams) using real-time dashboards, reports, and alerts.
    - Ensure proper dissemination to decision-makers with executive summaries and risk assessments.

## 6. **Feedback**:
    - Continuously refine and improve the intelligence process based on feedback from stakeholders.
    - Adjust collection methods, analysis techniques, and reporting formats to meet evolving threats and organizational needs.

**Tools Recommended**: MISP, Splunk, IBM X-Force, Anomali, ThreatConnect
