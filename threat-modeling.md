# Threat Modeling and Attack Surface Analysis

Threat modeling and attack surface analysis are crucial for identifying and mitigating potential vulnerabilities in your environment. This guide covers methodologies and tools to enhance your organization's defense.

## 1. **Threat Modeling Approaches**:
    - **STRIDE**: A framework that identifies threats based on six categories: Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service (DoS), and Elevation of Privilege.
    - **DREAD**: A risk assessment model that prioritizes threats based on Damage, Reproducibility, Exploitability, Affected users, and Discoverability.

## 2. **Attack Surface Analysis**:
    - **Network Scanning**: Use tools like **Nmap** to identify open ports and potential vulnerabilities.
    - **Application Scanning**: Use dynamic application security testing (DAST) tools like **Burp Suite** to assess web applications.
    - **Endpoint Detection**: Deploy endpoint protection platforms (EPP) and endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools like **CrowdStrike** and **Carbon Black**.

## 3. **Tools for Threat Modeling and Analysis**:
    - **Microsoft Threat Modeling Tool**: Provides a simple interface for modeling threats in an IT environment, including identifying and mitigating risks.
    - **OWASP Threat Dragon**: An open-source threat modeling tool for creating data flow diagrams and identifying potential risks.

**Tools Recommended**: Nmap, Burp Suite, Microsoft Threat Modeling Tool, OWASP Threat Dragon, CrowdStrike, Carbon Black
