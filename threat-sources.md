# Sources of Threat Intelligence

This guide outlines key sources of threat intelligence, categorized by internal, external, and industry-specific resources.

## 1. **Internal Threat Intelligence**:
    - **Log Files**: Analyze security event logs from network devices, firewalls, and endpoints.
    - **Incident Response Data**: Collect data from previous incidents and breaches.
    - **Vulnerability Scans**: Use internal scanning tools (e.g., Nessus, OpenVAS) to identify system vulnerabilities.

## 2. **External Threat Intelligence**:
    - **Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT)**: Publicly available information such as social media, security blogs (e.g., Krebs on Security), and government advisories (e.g., US-CERT, ENISA).
    - **Threat Feeds**: Subscription-based or community threat feeds such as FireEye iSIGHT, IBM X-Force, and CrowdStrike Falcon Intelligence.
    - **Dark Web Monitoring**: Use services like Recorded Future and Flashpoint to monitor criminal forums and marketplaces.

## 3. **Industry-Specific Intelligence**:
    - **Information Sharing and Analysis Centers (ISACs)**: Industry-specific ISACs (e.g., Financial Services ISAC, Healthcare ISAC) provide threat intelligence tailored to your sector.
    - **Government Sources**: FBIâ€™s InfraGard, DHS Automated Indicator Sharing (AIS), and the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA).

**Tools Recommended**: ThreatConnect, Recorded Future, FireEye iSIGHT, US-CERT, ENISA, ISACs
